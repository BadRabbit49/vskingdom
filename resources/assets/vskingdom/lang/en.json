While soldiers will fight for their country, their first priority is fighting for their leaders. If a citizen of a kingdom rebels, for instance, the soldiers under the command of that citizen will also become hostile to the kingdom. Additionally, soldiers cannot typically be harmed by other players unless at war or by their leader.\n\n<a href=\"handbook://block-vskingdom:post-iron-wood-live-good\">Outposts</a> are rally points for soldiers. These outposts act as a central hub for soldiers who won't stray too far from it. Different types of outposts have different stats depending on material and fuel. These outposts are used as a central respawn point for soldiers that get lost or die. Each death of a soldier will result in one token being subtracted however, which can eventually destroy the outpost completely."
